The run_analysis.r performed the following actions to the original data

*Merged the training and the test sets to create one data set.
*Extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
*Used descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
*Appropriately labeled the data set with descriptive variable names.
*Finally a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject was created.
